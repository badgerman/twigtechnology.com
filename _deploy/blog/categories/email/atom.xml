<h2>Thunderbird</h2>

<p>When you create a new account with a gmail.com address, Thunderbird will automatically guess the correct IMAP/SMTP servers and settings for you, but you still want to tweak that initial setup.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently abandoned the Gmail web interface in favor of good old mail user agents (MUA) like Thunderbird, K-9 Mail and mutt. This has been a wonderful experience all around, but there were a few settings I had to make that were not intuitive until I understood how Gmail operates. Namely, how it treats IMAP folders.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Folders vs. Labels</h2>

<p>At some point during its lifetime, Gmail introduced the concept of labels for conversations. Labeling a conversation would make it show up in a separate inbox on the left-hand side of the web UI, and it&rsquo;s easy to believe that these labels map to the IMAP concept of folders. This is compounded by the fact that Gmail&rsquo;s IMAP Server presents labels in this way, and lets you subscribe/unsubscribe from them through the IMAP folder mechanism.</p>

<p>However, labels are not folders. In IMAP, a message lived in only one folder at a time, and it is either in the Inbox, the Sent Mail folder or your recipe collection, but never in all of them. Gmail groups messages in conversations, and a message is found in all folders that correspond to the labels on any of its messages. Meaning if you sent an email to Mom about her cobbler recipe, and labeled her response with your Recipes label, or maybe even starred it, too, then both messages are now in the following folders of the Web UI:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inbox (because you received an email from Mom)</li>
<li>Sent Mail (because you sent at least one message in this conversation)</li>
<li>All Mail (Any and all messages go here)</li>
<li>Recipes (the label you chose)</li>
<li>Starred</li>
</ol>


<p>This is key to understanding why Gmail seems to be acting strange when used from another MUA.</p>

<ul>
<li>Send a message, and Gmail will automatically label it to appear in the <strong>Sent Mail</strong> folder. Instructing Thunderbird to keep copies of sent mails on the server will create duplicates.</li>
<li>To delete a conversation from a folder means to remove that label from it. The message is not physically deleted, and always remains in the <strong>All Mail</strong> folder.</li>
<li>Gmail&rsquo;s Archive command simply removes the <strong>INBOX</strong> label from the conversation. On a normal server, it would move the archived message from the inbox to a folder named Archives, and Thunderbird et al are built around that idea of archiving. If you specify an IMAP Archive folder in Thunderbird, that will simply add another Gmail label.</li>
<li>If you let Thunderbird copy anything to the <strong>All Mail</strong> folder, it may create another copy of the conversation?</li>
<li>Since <strong>All Mail</strong> is not a folder, but just a label that every conversation automatically carries, it is absolutely the worst choice for an Archive location (although I&rsquo;ve seen setup guides recommend it).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Gmail&rsquo;s not Email</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used Thunderbird in my examples because it is the most widely used desktop MUA, but these findings are true for every other mail program out there that implements the IMAP protocol. The problem is not with them, it&rsquo;s with Gmail implementing the protocol to describe something very different from what it was intended for.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a time long past. There was a period in the 90&rsquo;s when we had two classes of email programs. The ones that followed standards (mutt, pine, elm, Thunderbird), and the ones that tried to implement Internet Mail on top of existing corporate mail systems (Outlook, Lotus Notes). Usually, the latter had bad abstractions that made them do things like send Word documents, HTML messages or unrecognizable headers. Interestingly, Outlook Express looks like Microsoft&rsquo;s attempt to write a pure Internet Mail software that was unencumbered by corporate mail infrastructure like Exchange server or Lotus Notes.</p>

<p>The problem with all of these approaches is that they pretend to be something they are not, and they tried to jump onto a growth trend by subverting the standards. Remember how we all hated Microsoft for that? It looks as if Gmail is the Outlook of the 21st century, though. Piggy-backing on a standard that they only marginally support, just poorly enough to lure users in and then make them switch to their own implementation, which has its own restful API and is not handicapped by having to speak to the server in a language it only barely speaks, i.e. IMAP.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time we see Google doing this. They have used the RSS to prop up Reader and Currents, and their XMPP implementation has gone from decent (Google Talk) to legacy support (Hangouts) just this past year. Just like they are about to finally flip the switch on that, I would not be surprised if IMAP support for Gmail is going to disappear in the near future, too.</p>

    <id>http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/12/24/email-encryption</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a depressing thought: public-key encryption was around when I was in
college in the mid-90&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s still not widely adopted. Instead, it&rsquo;s
considered &ldquo;too complicated for regular users&rdquo;, and none of the major vendors
of email solutions has made an attempt to integrate encryption into their
software.</p>

<p>As long as the NSA and Google read every one of my emails, I want to have a way
of preserving my privacy. I&rsquo;m writing these instructions in the hope that some
of the people I communicate will find it easier to use encryption when
communicating with me.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Using GnuPG with Thunderbird</h2>

<p>PGP, or &ldquo;Pretty Good Privacy&rdquo;, is a standard for email encryption developed in
1991, and remains the de-facto standard until today. The most popular
implementation of the PGP standard is the Gnu Privacy Guard (commonly
abbreviated as GnuPG or GPG). On your computer, you will need to install a <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG download</a> that matches your operating system.</p>

<p>To integrate GnuPG into Thunderbird, you will need to install the <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/">Enigmail extension</a>.</p>

<h2>Using APG on Android</h2>

<p>On Android, PGP is implemented in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thialfihar.android.apg">APG App</a> that I mentioned in my previous posting.</p>

<h2>Inline PGP vs. PGP/MIME</h2>

    <link href="http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/12/23/using-gmail-with-k9/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-23T20:30:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/12/23/using-gmail-with-k9</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous article, I described how to set up Thunderbird for use with your
Gmail account. That solves my annoyances with the Gmail web interface, and
allows me to use PGP encryption in my emails, something I&rsquo;ll probably write a
post about later. However, I also have a series Android devices on which I also
read email, and the Gmail app on them has a few of the same problems, namely the
lack of encryption. How much does the NSA pay the major vendors so they don&rsquo;t
implement this, and make it harder on us?</p>

<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll show you how to set up the free K-9 Mail app, and add
a new identity to it, so we can prepare our eventual exit from Gmail altogether.
You may not choose to do that yet, but I did.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Send in the K-9 team</h2>

<p>Before you install K-9, you should <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thialfihar.android.apg">install
APG</a>.
It provides PGP encryption for Android, and for reasons I&rsquo;ve never understood,
K-9 insists that it be installed first if you want to use both of them together.
For now, forget that you did that, I&rsquo;m going to deal with encryption in a later
posting.</p>

<p>After that, install the K-9 Mail application on our phone. Get it from
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9">Google&rsquo;s Store</a>, or
Market, or whatever your phone calls it. These app are very undemanding, and
I&rsquo;ve installed them on anything from an old Froyo phone to the latest KitKat
tablet.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve installed K-9, you&rsquo;ll have to configure it to use your Gmail
account. As with Thunderbird, you will need to create another
<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833">application-specific
password</a> for this if you are
using two-factor authentication. You want to use a different one, so that if you
ever lose your phone, you can just revoke the password that it used and cut off
access to your email.</p>

<p>From the menu, choose &ldquo;add account&rdquo;, enter your full email address and the
password, and let the app find the incoming and outgoing server settings for
you. Just like with Thunderbird, this should happen automatically, so no
memorizing of host names or ports required. When all is done, you&rsquo;re prompted for
a name for the account and your own name, and taken to the account view. By
default, your account will be set up to not poll the inbox repeatedly, so you
might want to change the folder poll frequency in the settings to something like
every 15 minutes. Take a look around all the settings and consider what you want
your phone to be doing.</p>

<h2>New Identity</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m ultimately trying to get out of Gmail entirely, and I have a domain that&rsquo;s
hosted at netbeat with a catch-all email account on their POP3 mail server. It
would be cool if I could slowly migrate to an email address on that domain, but
I don&rsquo;t have the patience to set up my own IMAP server for it yet.</p>

<p>First step in this is to configure Gmail to fetch the emails from that domain.
I&rsquo;ve been doing this for a while now, and even though it means Google gets even
more data about me, it was worth it for their superior spam filtering.
Instruction on how to set up Gmail&rsquo;s Mail Fetcher can be found in Google&rsquo;s
support pages: <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/21289">Centralize mail from different accounts with Mail
Fetcher</a>.</p>

<p>The one disadvantage of this setup is that email now takes longer to be
delivered, because on top of K-9&rsquo;s polling frequency, each message now has to
first go to my domain host&rsquo;s servers, and then gets picked up by Gmail on a
regular schedule (up to an hour), so you should take that article&rsquo;s advice
and set up direct forwarding, too. How you do that differs based on your domain
host, so you&rsquo;re on your own there. When I did it, it caused my emails to arrive
almost instantly.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&rsquo;ll want to be able to send emails through Google&rsquo;s servers from
your new email address. Again, this is documented in the Google support pages:
<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370">Sending mail from a different
address</a></p>

<p>Once this works, you should have a drop-down in Gmail&rsquo;s web interface that lets
you choose which identity you want to send email from. By using your new
identity, you are slowly training everyone you communicate with that you&rsquo;ve got
a new address &ndash; the address will get collected into their address books. their
replies will be sent to it, etc. You may also want to add a signature to your
emails that explains your new address. Just make sure not to tell the spammers
:&ndash;)</p>

<p>Back to K-9: In the account settings, under &ldquo;Sending mail&rdquo;, select &ldquo;Manage
Identities&rdquo;, and from the menu choose &ldquo;New Identity&rdquo; to add your alternate email
address. Then long-press on the newly created identity and choose &ldquo;Move to top /
make default&rdquo;. K-9 will use this identity for all new messages, but in replies,
it will default to whatever address the email went to, and not switch. Don&rsquo;t
worry if that&rsquo;s confusing, you can always change whatever identity it chooses
from a drop-down at the top of the composition screen, for any message you
write.</p>

<p>Thunderbird has a similar mechanism for multiple identities, and you might want
to set it up there, too. Rather than describe it here, I&rsquo;ll just link the
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Mozilla_Suite_:_FAQs_:_Mail_Aliases">Mozilla Knowledge
Base</a> and hope
you&rsquo;ll figure it out for yourself.</p>

    <id>http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/12/23/using-gmail-with-thunderbird</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have had it with Gmail. The web interface is becoming more and more
antagonistic every day, and it is my firmly help belief that Gmail is not email.
Back in the days, Gmail was a standards-compliant service built on IMAP and SMTP,
with a fancy web interface. A web interface that eventually became so usable, it
convinced me that I did not actually need a desktop email application any longer.
Those days are over. The new Compose, the inability to use it with a PGP browser
extension, the G+ integration, the hopeless top-posting and that new thing where
every attachment gets stored into Drive are all making me harken back to a
simpler time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why stick with Gmail at all?</h2>

<p>It is tempting to make a radical departure and just set up my own mail service
on my own domain. And one day, that&rsquo;s what I intend to do, but not everyone can
do that, and I believe in taking incremental steps in the right direction. So
the first thing I&rsquo;m doing is getting rid of Gmail the web application, but I am
keeping Gmail the IMAP/SMTP service. I have had this email address for the last
10 years (I signed up November 11, 2004), and it&rsquo;s become impossible to just
stop using it overnight.</p>

<h2>Thunderbird is still the best.</h2>

<p>Unlike Microsoft and Google, the Mozilla Foundation seems to truly believe in
Internet standards and extensibility, and Thunderbird is still the best desktop
email software. It also exists on every major platform, so if I ever decide to
abandon Windows, it will still be wherever I go.</p>

<p>There is at this time no Thunderbird for Android or iOS, and I doubt that this
will happen anytime soon. However, other email software exists, and the Android
Gmail app is not as awful as the web application, so the mental trauma is not
quite as high.</p>

<h2>Thunderbird Setup</h2>

<p>Modern versions of Thunderbird (I am running 24.2) recognize a Gmail address in
their account wizard and they will configure the correct IMAP and SMTP server
for you, with the correct SSL/TLS settings. If you are using two-factor
authentication (you should!), then this is one of the cases where you need to
use an
<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833">application-specific password</a> to access
your Google account. Tell Thunderbird to remember it. You are encrypting your
hard drive, right?</p>

<p>Next, we need to do some configuration that Thunderbird doesn&rsquo;t get right, in
order to work around some behavior of Gmail that isn&rsquo;t like other IMAP servers.
Go to the newly created account settings, and configure the following sections:</p>

<h3>Server Settings</h3>

<p>Gmail calls its IMAP folders &ldquo;labels&rdquo;, and there are two kinds, the ones that
you defined, and the canonical ones, like Drafts, Trash, Sent Mail, etc. These
canonical folders all live under the <em>Gmail</em> folder of the IMAP folder
hierarchy. In this next step, we want to prevent Thunderbird from creating its
own copy of those canonical folders, and tell it to use the ones that Gmail
provides.</p>

<pre><code>When I delete a message: (*) Just mark it as deleted
</code></pre>

<p>The Gmail server automatically manages its internal Trash folder, and you don&rsquo;t
need to explicitly move deleted messages there.</p>

<h3>Copies &amp; Folders</h3>

<pre><code>When sending messages, automatically [ ] Place a copy in:
</code></pre>

<p>Leave this unchecked. Gmail&rsquo;s servers will automatically place a copy of every
outgoing message into the <em>Sent Mail</em> folder, and making another copy will just
create duplicates, and it really messes up the witless Gmail web interface.</p>

<pre><code>Message Archives [ ] Keep messages archived in:
</code></pre>

<p>Leave this unchecked, too. Google&rsquo;s equivalent of the Archive folder is the All
Mail label, which stores all Mail that you&rsquo;ve ever seen, and Thunderbird&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Archive"command seems to be doing the right thing (as in, something other than
the "Delete&rdquo; command).</p>

<pre><code>(*) Keep message drafts in: (*) Other:
</code></pre>

<p>We want to keep drafts in the Gmail Draft folder, not on a local computer, so
from the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; drop-down, choose your Gmail account, and then the Gmail/Drafts
folder.</p>

<pre><code>(*) Keep message templates in: (*) "Templates" folder in Local Folders
</code></pre>

<p>I must admit I&rsquo;ve never used Templates. There is probably an argument for
storing them on your Gmail account, so they are shared between all your
installations, but Gmail doesn&rsquo;t have the concept of Templates, so you&rsquo;d have to
create a custom label for them.</p>

<h3>Composition &amp; Addressing</h3>

<pre><code>[ ] Compose Messages in HTML format
</code></pre>

<p>This is where it all began. People flaunting the internet mail standards. Do us
all a favor and don&rsquo;t perpetuate that nonsense. You&rsquo;ll also want to disable this
if you have installed PGP encryption, because those two don&rsquo;t play well together.</p>

<h3>Junk Settings</h3>

<pre><code>[ ] Enable adaptive junk controls for this account
</code></pre>

<p>We should not be needing spam filters, because Gmail is doing a pretty awesome
job at filtering out junk email. It&rsquo;s one of the major reasons why people love
it so much. Thunderbird&rsquo;s junk filters do not integrate with the server-side
filtering of Gmail, so it&rsquo;s better to leave everything in this section
unchecked.</p>

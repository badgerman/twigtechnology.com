    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This month, I started developing a new Atlantis game, code-named Helios. I am
hoping that other developers will join my effort eventually, so I am spending
more time than usual on project management and documentation. Today sees the
end of my very first sprint, and I am pretty stoked about how much I got done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Project planning</h2>

<p>In agile development, the project gets broken down to sprints &mdash; intervals of time
that are easy to plan for. In my case, I am planning to do a print per month,
because it forces me to prepare a ton of design work, and because my time is
easier to predict for a month than a week. I think I can commit to 5 full days
of work during a month while still having a job.</p>

<p>For each of the sprints, I pick a few user stories, break them down to
bite-sized tasks which can be finished in less than a day, and assign as many of
these to the sprint as I think are possible to finish in a month. Since the
tasks are small and the design for their user story is complete and written
down, new contributors should be able to pick up any one of them that they feel
comfortable working on. For this purpose, I keep my
<a href="https://trello.com/b/EzbIyrUS/new-atlantis">task board on Trello</a> updated.</p>

<p>Even as a single-team developer, this helps me focus on my work. There is
satisfaction in seeing how many tasks I have moved, and I never wonder what
needs to be done next, so I don&rsquo;t work on stuff that isn&rsquo;t important.</p>

<h2>What got done</h2>

<p>I have planned an aggressive
<a href="https://github.com/badgerman/atlantis/wiki/Helios-Game-Design-Document">list of features</a>
for Helios, and I wrote Design rationale and a task breakdown for all of them.
This gives me material for all my future sprints until the start of the game.</p>

<p>The core feature I worked on for first was the most difficult one. I believe in
addressing risk head-on, so I worked on multi-hex movement for ships. Talking to
the atlantisdev folks helped me narrow the scope to only ships, which don&rsquo;t have
to worry about guards, terrain modifiers, and other complications to the source.
I also decided to delay the new action system I have planned, and in the end it
turned out to actually be pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>I got a lot of other small and large things shipped. My other focus was making
more things configurable on a per-game basis, by moving them into the json
configuration file:</p>

<ul>
<li>players start with 10 men and $2000, which are configurable values.</li>
<li>the width/height of the map is configurable, but stays fixed after world
generation, and does not need to be recalculated every time the data file is
loaded.</li>
<li>Regions have a unique id, and the neighbor-graph of all regions is stored in
the data file, which makes coordinates a merely cosmetic attribute of a
region. They are no longer needed to rebuild the region::connect array.</li>
<li>All regions are stored in a hash table, so they are fast to look up if you
know their unique ID.</li>
<li>Ship classes are configurable, with speed, cost, and capacity. The game is no
longer limited to only three types of ship, although the Helios game will
probably still have a longboat, clipper, and galleon.</li>
<li>I killed the original world generator, leaving only the code that was used in
Atlas. This will eventually be modified, too. It looks like the next sprint is
going to have world generation as one of its themes.</li>
<li>Terrain types are configurable. For Helios, all production in a region has
been reduced by 80%.</li>
<li>The code compiles on stock Ubuntu 13.04 again.</li>
<li>I compiled and familiarized myself with the ALH code.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What did and didn&rsquo;t work</h2>

<p>The atlantisdev group is a great sounding board for ideas. I am not a game
designer who creates things in a vacuum, and talking about my plans with other
people helps me a lot.</p>

<p>I am still looking for other developers to help me. Two people have stepped up,
and I have added them as collaborators to the Trello board, but none of them has
started on any task work.</p>

<p>Communication with other developers is mixed. I started an #atlantis IRC channel
on irc.lunarnet.org, but only one person has been showing up regularly.
Hopefully, this is going to get better. Please, if you are interested in
Atlantis developments, even just as a lurker, I want to talk to you.</p>

<p>Investigating ALH helped me get some ideas about world coordinates sorted out,
realizing that the code didn&rsquo;t need them, and as long as the client can draw a
map, neither do the players. I am probably going to let players choose how they
want them laid out on a per-faction basis, with a default preference for the
ALH layout.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-20T00:32:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/09/20/atlas-postmortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Atlas, my game of Atlantis 1.0 (with small modifications) is finally ending in
turn 22, by vote of the remaining players. There are 6 factions left, and it&rsquo;s
time to look at what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. I kind of knew a lot of this
beforehand (A1 is pretty well-known), but I have not seen a critical
retrospective of past games, and think it might be constructive to do a
write-up. I know a lot of this is fixed in A5 or Eressea, but remember I wanted
to go back to basics and see what the world was like 20 years ago when Russell
Wallace first created it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What worked</h2>

<ol>
<li>The game runs smoothly on all three types of machines I used: Windows (x64),
Ubuntu (x86) and Raspbian (ARM).</li>
<li>I have a very good setup for processing turns.</li>
<li>I can run multiple games side-by-side on the same machine (untested).</li>
<li>Kept a regular schedule, the automatic turns worked (almost) every weekend.</li>
<li>Few serious bugs: I had to re-run only 2 turns.</li>
<li>Hex maps: major new feature that didn&rsquo;t break.</li>
<li>JSON for reports: One player wrote a JavaScript mapping tool, and I wrote an order-template generator.</li>
<li>I killed the TEACH command, which reduced a ton of micro-optimization.</li>
<li>open-source game meant I was getting bug reports from people who read the code!</li>
</ol>


<h2>What didn&rsquo;t work</h2>

<ol>
<li>The map generator created too many unconnected continents.</li>
<li>Some players were on an island all by themselves.</li>
<li>Community: There wasn&rsquo;t much of a sense of community. I think that a forum
does not replace a weekly in-world newspaper.</li>
<li>The world in general was too big: I spawned three hexes per player, but in
the endgame, my faction is spread over two dozen hexes. Player drop-off really,
really hurts.</li>
<li>All regions are exchangeable, and mostly the same. I recruit peons in every
region, I tax as much as I can, and I build longbows/ships in forests vs.
swords/armor in mountains. There is no strategic component to terrain at all.
Why are swamps even in the game?</li>
<li>Movement is incredibly slow. Getting raw materials out of a mountain or
troops to the other end of the world is arduous.</li>
<li>Micromanagement: I spent way too much time writing orders to pass money and
materials around between units in the same region.</li>
<li>Way too many units! The way skills work make it beneficial not to merge
similar units, and the two major factions today both have in excess of 100
units.</li>
<li>Ships take too long to build. There are two longboats and one clipper, and as
many again that are still under construction.</li>
<li>Buildings: ditto. A single faction built all three buildings that exist in
the world.</li>
<li>There is a huge surplus of weapons and money. Taxation and Work are the main
sources of income.</li>
<li>There hasn&rsquo;t been a large-scale war, and even though factions have
researched all spells on levels 1+2, they haven&rsquo;t gotten to use them.</li>
<li>Community tool building: There is only one mapping tool that I know of, and
the player kept it to himself.</li>
<li>Hex directions: I gave the two additional directions unconventional names
(Mir and Ydd for NorthWest and SouthEast, respectively), so as not to have four
directions start with the same 2 letters (abbreviations are frequently used by
players when moving). This turned out to confuse people.</li>
<li>Wrap-around world. While it meant that nobody was at the edge of the map,
this hardly mattered (no ships), and players were confused about the relative
location of region (17,17) to (0,0). Not having tools made this worse.</li>
<li>The best strategy I observed was to send scout units out to look for players
that never made a turn. Each crunchy starting unit contains a yummy core of
$5000, which makes it worth to invest your entire starting capital to this rush
strategy.</li>
</ol>


<p>Did you play? The above are obviously just my impressions, but if you played and
disagree, or have something to add to my list, please add to it. I like
flattery, but also enjoy serious criticism. I&rsquo;m doing this to learn, after all.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>The game is playable, and anyone who would like to experience it should be able
to just pull it from github and play it. I think that in itself is a huge
success. At the same time, I didn&rsquo;t add a lot of bloat to it: You don&rsquo;t need an
XML library or OpenGL to run it, in fact my Raspberry Pi compiles it straight
from a fresh checkout :&ndash;) I wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing more development, but it would
take a bigger group of hackers. I have a huge list of ideas for features, in
fact, just not enough time to write them all. Let me list off what I came up
with during my hiking vacation (got to make the brain do something when you&rsquo;re
walking in the rain for 5 hours):</p>

<ol>
<li>Movement is kind of my #1 pet peeve. The current system makes ships
pointless, and there is no way to make a haste spell, or give riders a movement
advantage, or differentiate terrains. A system for multi-step moves needs to be
added.</li>
<li>Micromanagement sucks the joy out of the game. I&rsquo;m currently favoring
centralized upkeep from a faction-wide treasury, and city-based taxation instead
of local TAX orders.</li>
<li>Visual aids. I was toying with the idea of a GL renderer for maps, but did
not get very far.</li>
<li>Smaller ships. They take too long to build, and exploration only kicks off
when everything has already been discovered by land. Two types of ship are
probably enough.</li>
<li>Actual empire-building. The current buildings are bunk, but I have a design
for cities in my head, as economic centers of a player&rsquo;s empire, where taxation
and recruitment are located.</li>
<li>Fewer, better, units. I want to do Olympia-style stacks of nobles and common
units, and I have most of that code already written.</li>
<li>Starting a player off with more units and less money to take out the rush
strategy.</li>
<li>Make initial hiring of units for a rush harder by limiting recruiting to once
every season (every N turns), from cities only. I&rsquo;m sure that has other fun
side-effects, too.</li>
<li>Brainstorm on strategic value of terrain types. Movement penalties,
obviously. Limit ships to landing in plains only.</li>
<li>New combat rules, with more strategic bonuses from nobles and unit stacking.</li>
<li>Eliminate skills in favor of unit archetypes. Archers, Knights, Pikemen,
etc. have innate combat bonuses, and you recruit them for a combined price of
money + items.</li>
<li>No more money on units. All money is locked in the treasury of a city, and
cities pay upkeep or recruit units.</li>
<li>No more individual weapons and armor carried around by the units. If you
recruit an Archer, it is assumed that she has a longbow, and certain fixed
combat stats, plus situational modifiers. Some exceptions: mounts (horses,
griffons) for movement bonuses, and money, to transfer it between cities. It may
be that only nobles can carry money.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Want to help?</h3>

<p>So what I&rsquo;m proposing is a pretty radical change of the game design, and the
outcome is probably more Olympia than Atlantis 5 or Eressea, with a few actually
different elements. My time is sadly limited, to the point where for the past
weeks I have delegated the majority of my faction&rsquo;s order writing to somebody
else (yes, the micro-management is that bad).</p>

<p>My past experience with trying to build a new games has been mixed. In Eressea,
we were three programmers with quite different ideas about the game we wanted to
build, and the end result was pretty successful. Building a new game from the
Eressea code has failed at least twice now, either because I was the only
programmer, or because the baggage of the old game was so big. That experience
was my main motivation to look at A1 again. Which means the ideal people I would
like to work with check these requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programmers. Adding non-programmers to a project increases the chatter, and
does not increase actual productivity. Knowing what&rsquo;s possible in the code base
should inform what features are designed :&ndash;)</li>
<li>Seasoned C programmers. Portable C99 is my favorite language, and the game is
always going to be C at its core. I don&rsquo;t like C++ all that much, please do not
suggest it.</li>
<li>Atlantis Players. I would still want to run new games upon reaching feature
milestones, and developers should play in those games to see what works and what
doesn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Basic computer skills. Must be able to set up their own development machine,
know how to use IRC, ssh, git and a compiler.</li>
<li>Must be able to spell and form complete sentences. It&rsquo;s sad that this needs
to be said, but this is the world we live in.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you feel that you match this profile, and you have time and energy to work
on, drop me a note, and I&rsquo;ll see if there is enough of a response to kick this
off. It may not be today or this month, consider this offer good for a while.</p>

<p>Apart from people to work on a new game, I&rsquo;d also like to work on better
tooling. The ideas I have been tossing around are a GUI client, compatible JSON
reports for A5 and Eressea (for cross-game tool sharing), a unit scripting tool
(Lua), and a mobile app (at least a map). There&rsquo;s something to be said for
sharing this kind of work among as many games as possible, and I&rsquo;m favoring
things that are interoperable.</p>

    <link href="http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/01/16/stencyl-at-htf6/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-16T11:29:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2013/01/16/stencyl-at-htf6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday saw another installment of our
<a href="http://hackthefuture.org/" title="Hack The Future">popular children hackathon</a> at the Tech
Museum in San Jose. We get a room full of middleschool students, pair them with
hacker mentors, and let them play with all kinds of technology &ndash; programming,
electronics, robots, that sort of fun stuff.</p>

<p>I had decided that I wanted to show them how to make flash games in &lt;a
<a href="http://www.stencyl.com/" title="Stencyl">Stencyl</a>. It turned out to be a super popular
station, I feel like I gave a lot of kids the gift of game-making to take home,
and feedback was positive. Stencyl got mentioned as a highlight in quite a lot
of our feedback forms.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What really worked was knowing the tool that I was teaching, and having a plan
for how to introduce the kids to it. Stencyl is a game programming framework,
but I figured out that &ldquo;game&rdquo; is the fun part of that, and &ldquo;programming&rdquo; is more
of a necessary evil. Except it&rsquo;s not immediately necessary: The secret sauce to
my table was to use the pre-made example games in Stencyl (particularly the
run-and-gun game and the angry birds clone), and use them as a basis for
exploring the possibilities of Stencyl.</p>

<p>Very much like the Pong and Chess Javascript games I&rsquo;d used earlier, this gives
you a thing that already works: Starting with a single-level Angry Birds game
gives you something you can play immediately, and because the kids have all
played it on their phone, they know immediately that it is incomplete and have
ideas on how it should be made better. And the first steps to making it better
involve making content, not features: Everyone started building their own levels
(the built-in physics are fun, that also helps), and eventually got to a point
that needed a small bit of programming (transitioning from one level to the
next), so by the time they got in touch with the scratch-like language, it was
because they wanted to solve a very specific problem, and were already quite
familiar with how the game was constructed.</p>

<p>This was totally a recipe for making my life easier, too: I had to install the
game on their computer (bringing a USB stick saved my life), get them started
with the game and show them the level editor, and they&rsquo;d be self-sufficient for
the next 30 minutes. I will probably run this station exactly the same way again
next time. What didn&rsquo;t work well was when the kids wanted to make their own art:
The built-in image editor is not very good, didn&rsquo;t work at all on Linux, and
making game art takes a LOT of time during which you&rsquo;re not really learning
something about making games. I found it was best to steer away from that and
make them recycle the existing assets in creative ways.</p>

<p>Almost all the kids at my table installed Stencyl on their own computers, and I
feel positive that they&rsquo;ll work on their game (pun intended) until the next HtF,
because they clearly had fun. It was great that Stencyl works on Mac, Linux and
Windows, because I had about equal amounts of each come to my table, and it
would have been a shame to turn someone away.</p>

<p>Sore point that I want to improve: I didn&rsquo;t get to show anyone how easy it is to
embed the game they were making on a web page. I think that the ability to share
their games with friends at school might encourage them even more to keep
working on their project between events. Finding an easy way to share games is
something I want to do before Hack the Future 7, which is going to be at the
Computer History Museum in Mountain View on April 20.</p>

    <link href="http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2011/09/11/good-old-games-are-not/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-11T21:14:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.twigtechnology.com/blog/2011/09/11/good-old-games-are-not</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GOG.com is currently offering one of my all-time favorite games, <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/wing_commander_1_2">Wing
Commander</a> for purchase and
download. Even though I still have the original floppies somewhere, I whipped
out my credit card and figured I&rsquo;d spend a fun afternoon with it. My friend
Francis came over that day, and he&rsquo;d never heard of it (he is 20 years old and
was not yet born when the game was released), so I figured I&rsquo;d show him what a
great game it was. Except it turns out it isn&rsquo;t. Because we live in the future
now.</p>

<p>Never mind that it took a while to configure DOSBox properly, the game itself
just doesn&rsquo;t hold up to modern standards in so many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The aspect ratio of 4:3 (with occasional Letterbox bars in movie sequences) was stretched onto my 16:9 TV.</li>
<li>The controls keyboard+mouse, but WASD wasn&rsquo;t invented yet, and the mouse sensitivity is <em>all wrong.</em> Mice were new, and the OS didn&rsquo;t have sensitivity preferences.</li>
<li>The graphics are 320x200x8. The art is good within those limitations, but looks terrible to our modern eyes, especially on a 40" screen.</li>
<li>Support for my game pad is so bad that I chose to play without it. In fact, having it plugged in made the mouse cursor jitter. Joysticks for PCs were pretty unusual then, and they didn&rsquo;t have 16 buttons and weren&rsquo;t always analog.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the plus side, I was right about the game being crack for Francis. The story
is great, even full of tropes as it is, and the pacing works, the space combat
is exactly what a young nerd who has seen too much Star Wars wants it to be
like. There are likeable characters that you care about, and your protagonist&rsquo;s
character development is fantastic. This game would still be a blockbuster if it
was made today, with today&rsquo;s technology. But as it is, it runs in an emulator
and is stuck in the technological constraints of the very early 90s.</p>

<p>Compare this with the movies or music industry. If the only way to watch Charlie
Chaplin&rsquo;s movies today was to go to a cinema and watch it on the original
celluloid, few of us would even know who he is. But the movie industry has moved
with the times, and I can watch Metropolis on Blu-ray and Charlie Chaplin on
Netflix. And before this, they were available on VHS and Laserdisc.</p>

<p>I strongly believe the Game Industry is leaving lots of money on the table by
neglecting its back catalog in this way. There is an entire generation of
consumers that have never played the great games of the 90s, and we&rsquo;re
discouraging them from that because we&rsquo;re basically letting these games rot.</p>

<p>What it takes to keep these games attractive is not necessarily a reboot like
<a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/11/info-screens-on-starbreezes-syndicate-reboot-leak-onto-origin/" title="Syndicate Reboot">Syndicate</a>
or the <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/xcom-reboot-announced-is-an-fps-170957.phtml" title="X-COM Reboot">XCOM
FPS</a> every
couple of years. Those can be expensive and risky, as
<a href="http://www.dukenukemforever.com/" title="Duke Nukem Forever">DNF</a> should have taught
all of us. Why don&rsquo;t we just keep the original games fresh? When new hardware
comes along, or the way people consume games changes, it should be so much
easier to adapt an existing game to that then to make an entirely new game. To
use my Wing Commander example: Support game pads. Port it to consoles.
Sell it on Steam. If numbers are still good after 10 years, pay a studio to [re-make all the art]
(<a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=ultima+online+kingdom+reborn">http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=ultima+online+kingdom+reborn</a> &ldquo;UO: Kingdom Reborn&rdquo;)
in higher resolution, using the originals as their guide. Don&rsquo;t make me use an emulator.</p>

<p>There are a few games that get this. &lt;a
<a href="http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/" title="Another World">Another World</a> had a 15th
anniversary edition with new graphics and a port to Windows. Monkey Island
released a (Special Edition)[<a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=monkey+island+special+edition">http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=monkey+island+special+edition</a> &ldquo;Monkey Island Special Edition&rdquo;)
that was the darling of the press, because who doesn&rsquo;t love Monkey Island? It&rsquo;s
gorgeous, and it got me to play through one of my favorite games one more time.
And you know what? The story holds up, the humor is still funny, and it doesn&rsquo;t
feel like I&rsquo;m playing something that came out of a time capsule.</p>

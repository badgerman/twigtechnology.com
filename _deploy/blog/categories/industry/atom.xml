    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the news today, oh boy:
<a href="http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/10/08/report-microsoft-to-shut-down-massive-in-game-ad-division/">Report: Microsoft to shut down Massive in-game ad division</a>
This is a little upsetting, because we were early adopters of in-game
advertising with Anarchy Online, and it was one piece of the puzzle that makes
smaller titles possible and keeps them profitable.</p>

<p>I wonder what this means for Anarchy Online&rsquo;s Free-To-Play program? In-Game
advertising was a significant revenue stream I believe. Well, maybe Funcom will
sell the advertising boards themselves. I say put lolcats on all of them!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was at <a href="http://www.die-entwicklerkonferenz.de/">Quo Vadis</a> in Berlin earlier this week, and these are some of
my takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone loves GTA IV. GTA IV and CoD 4 were the games everyone wished
they would be making.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tibia.com/">CipSoft</a> is probably the most successful
  unknown German game developer. Tibia is a huge success
  internationally, with sales that almost everyone else would die for.</li>
<li>Never eat food from street vendors. My stomach has been in turmoil
  since Tuesday. The flight home was hell.</li>
<li>There are still MMORPGs in which you run the risk of a full 24 hours
  of rollback. Your players are probably a lot more forgiving than you
  give them credit.</li>
<li>Germany is missing the boat in online gaming. With the exception of
  some of <a href="http://www.travian.com/" title="Travian">the</a>
<a href="http://www.gameforge.de/" title="Gameforge">new</a>
<a href="http://www.bigpoint.com/" title="Bigpoint">kids</a> who started out as
  browser games.</li>
<li>We are still discussing violence. That debate is so last year. Still,
  Friday saw a panel on the issue of violence in games, but for some
  reason no mention of the
<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,552511,00.html">new legislation</a>
that passed the same day.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s still a very small industry. Germany has about 2,800 people
  developing games, and nobody is hiring foreign talent or interested in
  accommodating them. Even companies of 100+ employees still use German
  as their internal language.</li>
</ul>

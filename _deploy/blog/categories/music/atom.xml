    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Music has this annoying problem where it will sometimes barf on your MP3
files with the error message you see above. And it won&rsquo;t tell you what&rsquo;s wrong,
either. The internet doesn&rsquo;t know, either.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So I set out to take those unprocessed files and apply any change to them I
could think of, until one of them made the upload work. And the answer is
(drumroll): Bad VBR headers. I suspect these are created by bad MP3 encoders, in
my case by LAME3.99r.</p>

<p>To fix this, you can install Foobar2000 (still the best multi-format Swiss army
knife of a music player), and perform &ldquo;right click on the file &ndash;> Utilities &ndash;>
Fix VBR MP3 header&rdquo;. After you rewrite the file, Music Manager will detect that
it has changed, find it to be no longer broken, and upload it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to open up <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\MusicManager\FailureReport.txt</code> and
scan this for all the files that MusicManager complained about, then fix the MBR
headers on those.</p>

I was at [Quo Vadis](http://www.die-entwicklerkonferenz.de/) in Berlin earlier this week, and these are some of
my takeaways:

* Everyone loves GTA IV. GTA IV and CoD 4 were the games everyone wished
  they would be making.
* [CipSoft](http://www.tibia.com/) is probably the most successful
	unknown German game developer. Tibia is a huge success
	internationally, with sales that almost everyone else would die for.
* Never eat food from street vendors. My stomach has been in turmoil
	since Tuesday. The flight home was hell.
* There are still MMORPGs in which you run the risk of a full 24 hours
	of rollback. Your players are probably a lot more forgiving than you
	give them credit.
* Germany is missing the boat in online gaming. With the exception of
	some of [the](http://www.travian.com/ "Travian")
  [new](http://www.gameforge.de/ "Gameforge")
  [kids](http://www.bigpoint.com/ "Bigpoint") who started out as
	browser games.
* We are still discussing violence. That debate is so last year. Still,
	Friday saw a panel on the issue of violence in games, but for some
	reason no mention of the
  [new legislation](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,552511,00.html)
  that passed the same day.
* It's still a very small industry. Germany has about 2,800 people
	developing games, and nobody is hiring foreign talent or interested in
	accommodating them. Even companies of 100+ employees still use German
	as their internal language.

Google gave me one of these 10" tablets at GDC. People ask me how I like it
whenever they see it, and I finally have an opinion. It's a nice device,
overall, but I would not have paid the money for it. There's a place for it in
my life, albeit a small one.

The first thing people say when they pick it up is "this is heavy", and it is
true that it's heavier than the iPad, but I kinda like it. It feels substantial.
I have the 4G version without 4G, so I'm only using it on Wireless LAN, which
hasn't been a problem, since I don't carry it with me at all times. It's not
that kind of device.

Best usage scenarios so far:

* As a surface for looking at geocaching maps with others and planning a trip.
* As a TV companion to read up on Doctor Who lore.
* As bedside internet, keeping me from getting up in the morning.
* As a mobile phone, thanks to the Skype app.

## Pros:

* Android 3.0 is pretty cool. I like the UI of the OS quite a lot.
* The multi-tasking is really working.
* You get used to the idea that apps don't need to be closed after a while.
* It's made my Google Reader unread items count go down a lot.
* I like to keep it next to the bed, because it starts so much faster than a PC coming out of hibernation.
* Google Chat and Google Mail apps are fantastic.
* The HDMI output is great for presentations.
* Battery life is about 2 days with my usage pattern.
* Camera quality is light-years ahead of the iPod camera.

## Cons:

* There is no good IRC app.
* It does not charge over USB. I now have yet another charger.
* Some apps don't know how to cope with the screen size (Caltrain!)
* The web browser frequently stops loading things, reboot is the only fix I've found.
* No netflix app.
* The Skype app doesn't have video.

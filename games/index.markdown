I have worked as a programmer on a number of commercial AAA games. The
successfully released ones are listed at
(MobyGames)[www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,42844/ "My Mobygames Profile"].

## Anarchy Online \(Funcom, 2001\)

This game may have had the worst launch in MMO history, but it has persevered.
We spent an inhuman amount of work to turn the fortune of this title around, and
more than a decade later, it is still alive, beloved by hardcore fans, and even
getting a graphics engine update.

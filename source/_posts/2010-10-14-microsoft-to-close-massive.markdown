I read the news today, oh boy:
[Report: Microsoft to shut down Massive in-game ad division](http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/10/08/report-microsoft-to-shut-down-massive-in-game-ad-division/)
This is a little upsetting, because we were early adopters of in-game
advertising with Anarchy Online, and it was one piece of the puzzle that makes
smaller titles possible and keeps them profitable.

I wonder what this means for Anarchy Online's Free-To-Play program? In-Game
advertising was a significant revenue stream I believe. Well, maybe Funcom will
sell the advertising boards themselves. I say put lolcats on all of them!
